Working of project
Utilized the Swiggy Live API to access real-time restaurant data within your city, effectively presenting this information with relevant details including Area name, Cuisines Category, and Ratings. Enabled users to easily search for specific restaurants by name and explore comprehensive lists of dishes with price details. Implemented a streamlined cart system for a hassle-free ordering experience, currently working for Bengaluru.

Bugs Fixes:
Not responsive for Mobile phones
Cart data is not stored anywhere, it should be in local storage for not logged in users to avoid losing on refresh page.
While Signing up, user name is not displayed in the profile point instantly, needs a refresh. It doesn't happen in logging in process.
Improve the design, take user address and payment details.
